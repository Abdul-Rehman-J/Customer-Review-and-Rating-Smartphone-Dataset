The camera is not good at night photos, always have to disconnect the call at once and call again to continue as in 1st time there is no voice from my side to the other person. The phone looks bulky as compared to OnePlus. I have to change it asap and switch. I am not happy with this phone at all.",Lakhimpur,8 days ago,0,0
