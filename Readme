The dataset consists of 9 columns
1.	product_id: Product id

Interpretation:
The ratings are number of Stars given my customer to the product.
These stars can be interpreted in many ways like
•	Sentiment ( Positive or Negative )
This can be achieved by forming into a binary classification model with a threshold function like
rating >=4 -> Positive
rating <4 -> Negative
•	Ratings
This can be achieved by considering ratings as individual class. Several other visualisations, interpretations and models can be drawn from the dataset.
